# 📝 To-Do List App

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a simple **Online To-Do List** application built with **HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS)**, and **JavaScript**.  
It helps users manage daily tasks by allowing them to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, **mark as complete**, and **filter tasks**.  
Tasks are saved using **browser localStorage**, so they stay saved even if you refresh the page.
